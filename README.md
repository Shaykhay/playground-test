Gemini API Flutter Integration – Test Project
Overview
This is a small test project I put together to see how a Flutter app could talk to Google’s Gemini API, get back a JSON response, and use that data to update the UI on the fly.

The idea was simple:
Ask Gemini for some UI details (title text, background color, button color, etc.)
Parse the response into a Dart model (GeminiResponse).
Convert the color names from the API into actual Flutter Color objects.
Apply those styles instantly in the app.

How It Works
1. Sending a Request to Gemini
The app sends a text prompt to Gemini asking for a JSON object with specific layout details.
Example prompt:

final prompt = "Give me UI layout details in JSON with: title, backgroundColor, buttonColor, nameFieldColor, emailFieldColor";
3. Parsing the Response
Gemini replies with something like:

 
{
  "title": "User Interface",
  "backgroundColor": "black",
  "buttonColor": "grey",
  "nameFieldColor": "white",
  "emailFieldColor": "white"
}
I created a simple GeminiResponse model to parse this data. The model is flexible so it won’t crash if some fields are missing.

3. Converting Color Names to Color
The API returns colors as plain text like "black" or "blue".
I wrote a _parseColor function to match these strings to Flutter’s built-in colors.

4. Updating the UI in Real Time
Once the response is parsed and the colors are ready, it’s just a matter of:

Getx Controllers which helps alot managing states and values
The UI updates instantly based on Gemini’s suggestions.

Why This Test Is Useful
This little experiment shows that it’s entirely possible to:

Build AI-driven, dynamic UI updates.
Safely parse and use AI-generated JSON data.
Remove the need for hardcoded themes or layouts.
In a real-world app, you could extend this approach to update fonts, padding, spacing, and even entire widget trees — all based on AI responses.

Next Steps:
Add error handling for unknown color names.
Support HEX values in addition to named colors.
Expand the model to handle fonts, sizes, margins, and other layout details.
